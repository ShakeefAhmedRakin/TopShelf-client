### Features

<hr>

#### 1. Download as PDF

I've added a feature that allows users to download the currently viewed page of a book as a PDF document. This feature provides users with the ability to save a copy of the content for offline reading or reference.

#### 2. User Filtered Borrowed Books

I've implemented a user-filtered borrowed books section. This feature enables users to only view the books they've borrowed, making the information more secure to each user.

#### 3. User Authentication

I've integrated user authentication into my website, offering two options: email/password login and Google login.

#### 4. JWT Token Verification

I've enhanced the security of my website by implementing JWT token verification for CRUD operations on the "All Books" and "Add Books" pages. This ensures that only authorized users can perform these actions.

#### 5. Axios Interceptors for API Requests

I've used Axios interceptors to handle all API requests on my website. This allows me to manage and modify requests and responses globally, improving the efficiency and consistency of API interactions.

#### 6. Updating Book Details

I've ensured that when book details are updated, these changes are reflected throughout the entire website, including the borrowed books section. This provides a seamless and consistent user experience.

#### 7. Filter Available Books

I've added the capability for users to filter the "All Books" page to display only available books.

#### 8. React Hook Form

I've added the capability for users to filter the books page to display the books they search for as they type in the form.
